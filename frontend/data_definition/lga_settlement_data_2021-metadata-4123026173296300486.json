  "abstract": "This dataset presents the number of permanent settlers in Australia by migrations streams; humanitarian, family and skilled. The data covers migrating settlers with a Date of Settlement between 01/07/2020 and 30/06/2021. The location data is aggregated based on the Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries of the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).<br/><br/>\n\nThe data in this dataset are sourced from the Settlement Database (SDB). Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit <a href=\"https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/8d1b90a9-a4d7-4b10-ad6a-8273722c8628\" target=\"_blank\">Data.gov.au</a>.<br/><br/>\n SUDO has spatially enabled the original data with the 2011 LGA boundaries of the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1259.0.30.001Main+Features1July%202011?OpenDocument\">ABS Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC)</a>. Where the recorded number of settlers is less than 5 (\"<5\" in the original table), it has been set to 4 for confidentiality.",
