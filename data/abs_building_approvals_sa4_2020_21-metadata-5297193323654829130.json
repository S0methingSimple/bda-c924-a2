The data has been aggregated and presented by Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) 2016 boundaries.<br/><br/>\n\nStatistics of building work approved are compiled from: permits issued by local government authorities and other principal certifying authorities; contracts let or day labour work authorised by commonwealth, state, semi-government and local government authorities; and major building approvals in areas not subject to normal administrative approval e.g. building on remote mine sites.<br/><br/>\n\nThe scope of the collection comprises the following: construction of new buildings; alterations and additions to existing buildings; approved non-structural renovation and refurbishment work; and approved installation of integral building fixtures. The statistics include all approved residential building valued at $10,000 or more and all approved non-residential building valued at $50,000 or more.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/building-and-construction/building-approvals-australia/jan-2022\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Explanatory Notes</a>.<br/><br/> <ul>\n<li>SUDO has spatially enabled the original data from the ABS.</li>\n<li>The data has been sourced from the Jan 2022 release.</li>\n</ul>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"sa4_code","type":"String","title":"SA4 Code","description":"SA4 Code (ASGS 2016)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"new_houses_no","type":"Integer","title":"Number of New Houses","description":"New houses.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"new_other_residential_building_no","type":"Integer","title":"Number of New Other Residential Buildings","description":"New other residential building.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa4_name","type":"String","title":"SA4 Name","description":"SA4 Name (ASGS 2016)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"total_dwellings_no","type":"Integer","title":"Total Dwelling Number","description":"Total dwellings.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"value_of_new_houses_000","type":"Double","title":"Value of New Houses ($000)","description":"Value of new houses..","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"value_of_new_other_residential_building_000","type":"Double","title":"Value of New Other Residential Building ($000)","description":"Value of new other residential building.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"value_of_non_residential_building_000","type":"Double","title":"Value of Non-Residential Building ($000)","description":"Value of non-residential building.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"value_of_total_building_000","type":"Double","title":"Value of Total Buildings ($000)","description":"Value of total building.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"value_of_total_residential_building_000","type":"Double","title":"Value of Total Residential Buildings ($000)","description":"Value of total residential building.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"vle_altrtns_addtns_incldng_cnvrsns_rsdntl_bldng_000","type":"Double","title":"Value of Alterations ($000)","description":"Value of alterations and additions including conversions to residential building.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","feature":{"key":"sa4_code","geoLevel":"sa4_2016","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[96.81676569599999,-43.740509603,159.109219008,-9.142175977],"featureType":"country","featureInstance":"au","featureName":"Australia","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":[]}}
